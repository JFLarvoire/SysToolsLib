## [Unreleased] 2023-04-12
### Fixed
- in.exe and with.exe: Fixed command-line quoting and escaping issues in DOS & Windows versions,
  by copying the actual command line instead of rebuilding it.
  Also moved that code into new SysLib routine DupArgLineTail(), and moved CondQuoteShellArg() to SysLib.

## [Unreleased] 2023-03-31
### Changed
- Batch/IpCfg.bat:

- SysLib: Added an OS-independent SetCursorPosition() routine.

### Fixed
- chars.exe:
  * Fixed the remaining alignment issues in DOS & Unix.
  * Avoid hanging in FreeBSD.
  * Fixed the performance issues in all versions of Unix.
- C/SysLib/GetCurPos.c: Fixed the DOS version and made pointer arguments optional.

## [Unreleased] 2023-01-23
### Fixed
- Fixed many Shell scripts compatibility with FreeBSD & MacOS.

## [Unreleased] 2023-01-18
### New
- Added a config.h file, automatically generated for each target OS.
  * This fixes a bug for DOS builds: DOS.mak now stores the HAS_SDK_* definitions in that new config.h, instead of passing them on the CC command line. Then DOS.mak prepends a #include <config.h> at the beginning of all C/C++ sources that don't have one, before compiling them. This fixes the MSVC 1.52c "Out of memory" errors we got when the command line PLUS the PATH and INCLUDE variables were too long. (~512 bytes total?)
  * This also allows to automatically configure variables in Unix builds, reporting the presence or absence of optional features and libraries.
- Added a GetCursorPosition() routine in SysLib, with versions for DOS, Windows, and Linux.

### Fixed
- chars.exe: Output columns are now correctly aligned when outputing to the console, even after characters that do not move the cursor.
  (Uses the new GetCursorPosition() to detect when the cursor did not move, and outputs an extra space in that case.)

## [Unreleased] 2023-01-16

- with.exe version 1.0: New `with` program, to execute a command with specific environment variables.
- echoargs: Unix script, equivalent to Windows' echoargs.bat and echoargs.ps1, to display a list of arguments.

### Fixed
- Window.ps1: Fixed the -OnTop operation, which failed to move some Explorer windows to the foreground.
- update.exe: Make sure the -R option displays the timestamp changes done.
- Which.exe: Corrected the help message in the Unix version.
- C/SysLib/oprintf.h: Fixed oprintf compilation in FreeBSD.
- *.exe, cfdt.tcl, umountw.bat: Removed my old HPE email address in all help messages, and factored-out the info.
- autorun.cmd: Fixed the installation with option -i from a SysToolsLib.zip distribution.
- md2h.bat: Fixed the same issue as in autorun.cmd with a `for /f` command.

## [Unreleased] 2022-12-31
### Changed

- trim.exe version 2.1.4: Removed the line size limitation.
- whichinc.exe version 1.4.1: Removed the line size limitation.
- zap.exe version 1.6.1: Removed the piped input line size limit.

- C/include/dos.mak, lodos.mak, bios.mak: Fixed lots of issues with the DOS, LODOS, and BIOS builds.

## [Unreleased] 2022-12-01
### New
- C/MsvcLibX: Added routines setenv.c() & unsetenv().

### Changed
- whichinc.exe version 1.4:  
  Search the next include file when finding an MsvcLibX MSVC_INCLUDE_FILE() or UCRT_INCLUDE_FILE() macro.  
  Added option -q to avoid displaying minor errors, etc.  
  Display less information by default, and move the rest to the verbose and debug modes.
  Make sure all paths are displayed with \ in DOS/Windows.
- macros.cpp: Added (but left compiled-out) an experiment on how to display macro values at compile time.

## [Unreleased] 2022-11-30
### Changed
- C/*: Numerous tweaks and fixes for BIOS/LODOS/DOS builds compatibility.

## [Unreleased] 2022-11-27
### Changed
- zap.exe: Added the ability to get the list of pathnames to delete from stdin.

### New
- C/include/LODOS.mak: New make "OS=LODOS" option, for generating  executables that only use the LoDosLib and BiosLib
  libraries. The advantage compared to pure BiosLib-based program (ie. MINICOM programs) is that the standard output
  can be redirected.
- C/include, C/BiosLib, C/LoDosLib: Many changes and additions to support generating BIOS, LODOS, and DOS versions of
  the same program without conditional compilations in its source.  
  Low Dos builds (previously called minicoms) also are builds for MS-DOS, but only using the LoDosLib & BiosLib libraries.  
  This allows building smaller executables for DOS, when size is critical, for example on floppy disks.  
  This also allows building DOS device drivers and TSRs, which are incompatible with the MS C library for DOS.

### Fixed
- cpuid.exe: Fixed the DOS version output which could not be redirected, by making sure it actually builds as a LODOS app.

## [Unreleased] 2022-11-21
### Changed
- cpuid.exe: Added a WIN64 version.
  Added option -c to manually test one CPUID call.
  Rewrote support for cpuid(0x0B), now superseded by cpuid(0x1F).
  Added many new feature bits definitions.
  Added the short alias for each feature bit.
  Don't display a computed processor name if we have the brand string.
  Use debug and experimental features in debug builds only.
  Restructured main() to use action flags and subroutines.
  Added options -a, -f, -n, -t to invoke individual actions.
  Added option -q to query if a given feature or feature set is available.
  Added option -ls to list supported feature sets.
  Decode leafs 4, 16H, 17H, 18H, 1AH.
  Display the reserved feature bits that are set.
  Streamlined the output in non-verbose mode; Additional details in verbose mode.
  Option -w alone calls DisplayWmiProcInfo().

### Fixed
- cpuid.exe: Fixed the extended family and model calculations and display.
  Fixed a bug displaying the measured frequency in DOS.

## [Unreleased] 2022-10-22
### Changed
- junction.exe: Added option -t, modifying options -l and -r, to list all types of reparse points, and displaying their type.

- C/SRC/macros.cpp: Output valid #define directives, to match Unix compilers (and now MSVC 16.8+) built-in abilities.                
  Added a help screen, and a -V (get version) option.  	    
  Fixed warnings in MS-DOS and MacOS LLVM builds.	    
- C/Include/*.h, C/SysLib/*.h,*.c,*.cpp: Changed the encoding to UTF-8, and added a Unicode BOM to C/CPP sources.
- C/Include/DOS.mak: Generate localized C sources only once for all DOS builds.
  This is faster, and also resolves the case of CPP sources including other CPP sources with a UTF-8 BOM.
- C/SysLib/IsSwitch.c, C/SysLib/mainutil.h, C/SRC/*.c: Factored IsSwitch() out of C/SRC/*.c, and moved it to a new module in SysLib.
- C/include/All.mak: Allow cleaning just one OS. Ex: `make "OS=DOS" clean`  
  Also `make clean` does not delete Unix builds anymore.

### Fixed
- C/SysLib/WalkDirTree.c: Avoid errors in MacOS.

## [Unreleased] 2022-10-13
### Changed
- cfdt.tcl: Added options --pf and --ps, to better control the --m2n option effect.
- dirc.exe: Separate new option -I (ignore <=2s) from -i (ignore TZ).

## [Unreleased] 2022-08-08
### Fixed
- update.exe: Fixed errors "Failed to create directory PATHNAME. File exists." when updating files below a junction on
  a network server.                             

## [Unreleased] 2022-07-10
### Changed
- 1clip.exe:  
  Added option -s to get the clipboard data size.

  Added routine :GetUserEmail.  
  Improved routine :RunAsAdmin.

### Fixed
- 2note2.bat: Fixed the issue with the extra CRLF appended to the text.

## [1.21.1] 2022-02-26
### Fixed
- C/MsvcLibX/include/sys/types.h, C/MsvcLibX/include/wchar.h, C/SRC/junction.c:  
  Corrected the definitions for MSVC's own _dev_t and _ino_t types, used in its stat* structures.
- 2clip.exe, 2note.exe, conv.exe, detab.exe, dump.exe, remplace.exe, trim.exe:

- Tcl/regsub.tcl: New tool to change text using regular expressions.

### Changed
- Tcl/README.txt: Converted to README.md, and updated.

### Fixed
- C/include/debugm.h: Fixed bugs that broke debug builds in Linux.

- C/SRC/sector.cpp: Added support for floppy disks.

### Changed
- C/SRC/sector.cpp, C/SRC/gpt.cpp: Updated the FormatSize() routine to make it more readable, and fixed the output in DOS.

### Fixed
- C/SRC/sector.cpp: When copying disk images into an existing file, the image was appended to the file, instead of
  overwriting it.

## [Unreleased] 2017-07-09
### New
- C/SysLib/VxDCall.c & VxDCall.h: Routines for WIN95 applications calling VxD WIN32 services, and VxD Device IO Controls.
- C/SysLib/HDisk95.c: New implementation using DPMI to call V86 int 13H. Uses VxDCall.c & VxDCall.h.

### Fixed

### Changed
- Tcl/cfdt.tcl: Display the list of files processed, to monitor progress.

### Fixed
- Tcl/cfdt.tcl: Do not display help if wildcards produce 0 names.

### Added
- Batch/PySetup.bat: A tool for configuring *.py scripts to use one of the Python interpreters available.

## [Unreleased] 2017-05-31
### Added
- C/SRC/asInvoker.manifest, asInvoker.rc: Default manifest to use for WIN95 and WIN32 builds.

### Changed
- C/SRC/conv.c, detab.c, lessive.c, remplace.c, update.c: Display MsvcLibX library version in DOS & Windows.
  This allows tracking new builds with updated libraries, when the tools C sources have not changed.
  The help still displays the main program version only, to limit the first line size.

### Fixed
- C/include/win32.mak: Use the new asInvoker.manifest by default for WIN95 and WIN32 builds. This allows fixing issues
  with unprivileged accesses to C:\ or %ProgramFiles% silently redirected to %LOCALAPPDATA%\VirtualStore\...
- C/MsvcLibX/include/string.h: Added a prototype for our modified version of strerror(), avoiding the link warning:
  LIBCMT.lib(strerror.obj) : warning LNK4006: _strerror already defined in MsvcLibX.lib(strerror.obj); second definition ignored
- C/SRC/conv.c, detab.c, lessive.c, remplace.c: Added error message for failures to backup or rename the output files.

## [Unreleased] 2017-05-11
### Added
- C/MsvcLibX/include/msvclibx_version.h: Defines the MSVCLIBX_VERSION string.

### Changed
- C/MsvcLibX/src/dirent.c: Recognize LinuX SubSystem symlinks.
- C/SRC/remplace.c, C/SRC/update.c: The -V option now displays the MsvcLibX library version in DOS & Windows.
  This allows to see if an executable built from an unchanged source contains bug fixes from a newer version of the MsvcLibX library.

### Fixed
- C/MsvcLibX/src/fopen.c: In case of error, fopen() returned a wrong errno in some cases.
- C/MsvcLibX/src/iconv.c: Fixed fputc() for files in binary mode.
- C/MsvcLibX/src/junction.c: Dynamically allocate debug strings in junction(). This prevents stack overflows in debug mode.
- C/SRC/gpt.cpp, sector.cpp: When listing drives, tolerate missing indexes, as one drive may have been recently unplugged.
- C/SRC/remplace.c: Detect the input encoding, and convert the old and new replacement string to that encoding.
  This allows replacing non-ASCII strings, whether they come in from a pipe (using the console code page), or from an ANSI or UTF-8 text file.

## [1.8.1] 2017-04-12
### Fixed
- C/MsvcLibX/src/main.c: Fixed a bug that caused command-line arguments to be lost in some cases.
- C/MsvcLibX/src/iconv.c: Added missing routine puts(). This fixes a last-minute bug in the 1.8 release, that prevented
  the (unreleased) debug versions of the programs from displaying debug output.

## [1.8] 2017-04-05
### Added
- C/BiosLib: A library of routines for writing C programs running in the legacy BIOS. Previously released within HP in the early 2000s as NoDosLib.
- C/LoDosLib: A library of routines for writing MS-DOS drivers and TSRs.
- C/PModeLib: A library of routines for managing the x86 processor protected mode.

### Changed
- C/Files.mak now checks which subdirectories exist, and build those present.
- C/src/tee.c: Changed to a UTF-8 app, to support non-ASCII file names.

### Fixed
- C/*/configure.bat, C/*/make.bat: Avoid defining environment STINCLUDE after exit.
- C/MsvcLibX/include/*.h: Many small compatibility fixes.
- C/MsvcLibX/src/*: Make sure all debug prints are done in UTF-8.
- C/include/debugm.h: The Windows version of debug prints is now thread-safe.
- C/MsvcLibX/src/realpath.c: Fixed resolution for relative paths.

## [unreleased] 2017-03-16
### Added
- C/SRC/codepage.c: A new tool for displaying information about the current and available console code pages.

### Changed
- C/SRC/update.c: Now includes a workaround for the WIN32 incompatibility with pathnames ending with spaces or dots.
- C/SRC/sector.cpp: Added a dirty workaround for Windows' auto-mount feature, which prevented from copying
  a full disk image to a blank disk. (As soon as it detects a valid partition table, Windows mounts it, which locks the drive.)
- C/SRC/chars.c: Added an optional code page argument, for displaying characters for a different Windows code page.

## [unreleased] 2017-03-12
### Added
- C/include/configure.bat, make.bat: Added support for Visual Studio 2017
- C/include/src2obj.bat, src2obj.mak: Allows declaring SOURCES instead of OBJECTS in Files.mak. Much simpler to use. See example in C/MsvcLibX/Files.mak.
- C/include/All.mak: Use variable DIRS from Files.mak to recurse into all the subdirectories to build.
- C/MsvcLibX/src/open.c: New UTF-8 version of open().
- C/MsvcLibX/src/getpagesize.c: New UTF-8 version of getpagesize().
- Added UTF-8 versions of fputc() and fwrite().
- Added configuration variable IGNORE_NMAKEFILE for dealing with unwanted NMakefile homonyms.

### Changed
- UTF-8 programs now write 16-bits Unicode to the console. This allows displaying any Unicode character, even if it's not in the current code page.
  When stdout is redirected to a pipe or a file, the output is still converted to the current code page. This is the same as cmd.exe's own behaviour.
- Redesigned UTF-8 programs initialization. Now compatible with any main() routine declaration, with 0 or 2 or 3 arguments.
- configure.bat and make.bat do not automatically set persistent environment variables with the library paths.
  This did more harm than good, when dealing with multiple copies of the libraries.
  It's possible to revert to the old behaviour by defining PERSISTENT_VARS first.
- Many small changes and bug fixes.

## [1.7] 2017-01-09
### Added
- C/SRC/inicomp.c: A tool for comparing .ini or .reg files.

### Changed
- C/SRC/dict.h, - C/SRC/tree.h: Added the ability to create multimap-like dictionaries, for use in inicomp.c.

## [unreleased] 2016-12-31
### Added
- C/SRC/msgbox.c: A tool for displaying various types of Windows Message Boxes from batch files.

## [unreleased] 2016-12-16
### Changed
- C/include/configure.bat:
   - Updated the batch library framework.
   - Configure sub-projects recursively by default. 
   - Added option -R to prevent recursion if desired.
   - Fixed displaying the output of sub-instances of this script.
   - Avoid duplicate searches of MS tools in sub-instances, and of our own libs in some cases. (Known bug: We're still searching our own libraries multiple times in many cases.)
   - Added option -p to request setting persistent library path variables. By default, don't.
- C/include/make.bat:
   - Updated the batch library framework.
   - Improved the heuristic to detect pseudo-targets that need not be logged. (Ex: clean)
   - Added option -q to force running nmake without capturing its output. (Default for pseudo-targets)
   - Added option -Q to force capturing nmake output into TARGET.log. (Default for real targets)
- Batch/regx.bat: Updated the batch debugging framework.
- Batch/trouve.bat: Improved output filtering to convert / to \ only in file names, and fixed a few bugs.

### Fixed
- Batch/Library.bat:
   - Fixed issues when sourcing this library from another script.
   - Changed %EXEC% to not capture commands output by default. Fixes a usability bug: Not %EXEC% without options is fully transparent.

## [unreleased] 2016-12-09
### Changed
- Batch/Library.bat:
   - Added the ability to source Library.bat from another batch script.
   - Added routine :Prep2ExpandVars, useful for passing variables across endlocal barriers.
- C/SRC/sector.cpp and gpt.cpp:
   - Reformated the source to modern coding standards.
   - Improved the partition size formating readability.
   - Use the same units (GB, not GiB, etc) for disk and partition sizes.
   - Added options -H and -I to control the disk and partition size SI unit.
   - In gpt.cpp, added options -t and -x to control the sector number base (10 or 16).
   - Added many new partition types.
   - Added option -V to display the version.

### Fixed
- C/include/configure.bat and make.bat: Numerous fixes.
- PowerShell/PSService.ps1: Fixed incorrect hyphen.
- Batch/Library.bat:
   - %RETURN% failed if an UPVAR value contained a '?'.
   - %EXEC% exit code was not displayed correctly when called with expansion disabled.
   - %EXEC% failed if commands contained a ^.
   - %FUNCTION% incorrectly displayed arguments containing ^!% in debug mode.
   - %POPARG% now correctly handles trick characters ^!% correctly in all expansion modes.
- Batch/regx.bat:
   - Restructured to fix serious issues if value names or values contained tricky characters like: ^!%
   - The -X option now works correctly.
   - Enumerating 0 sub-keys in a valid key does not return an error anymore.

## [unreleased] 2016-11-07
### Changed
- Fixed and improved the way C make files and scripts use the optional OUTDIR.
- C/include/configure.bat: Performance improvements and fixed bugs with very old Visual Studio versions.
- Batch/Library.bat: Updated the recent %EXEC% entry errorlevel fixes to work with %DO% too.

## [unreleased] 2016-11-05
### Changed
- Updated the make scripts and make files to always reuse the initial script instance, when invoked recursively in subdirectories.
- C/include/configure.bat now has a -r option for recursively configuring every C subdirectory.
- C/include/make.bat now automatically uses the top instance log file, avoiding the need to explicitely use the -L option in recursive calls.
- Clarified "make cleanenv" output: It now displays the actual commands it had to run to cleanup the environment, or nothing if there was no need.
- Batch/Library.bat: Indent sub-scripts output in debug mode.

### Fixed
- Batch/Library.bat: Avoid log file redirection failures in recursive scripts.
- Several make files had the clean target defined twice, which caused a make warning. (Although it did work fine.)
- C/include/make.bat displayed a "file not found" error in recursive makes. (Due to incorrect log file handling in this case.)
- Several configure.*.bat files had the unwanted side effect of creating %OUTDIR%.
- Batch/u2w.bat and w2u.bat: Use remplace.exe new option -st instead of -t.

## [unreleased] 2016-10-21
### Changed
- Fixed various bugs and added missing inference rules, so that it's now possible to build assembly language programs in 16, 32, and 64-bits modes.
- Added commands del and rd to regx.bat.

## [unreleased] 2016-10-19
### Fixed
- Bugs in configure.bat, make.bat, and library.bat, that sometimes caused build failures in Windows XP.

## [unreleased] 2016-10-18
### Added
- Tcl/nlines.tcl: A tool for counting non-commented source lines.

## [1.6.2] - 2016-10-13
### Added
- C/SysLib/: A directory, with a new System Management library. See the README there for details.
- C/SRC/sector.cpp: Source for building sector.exe, a tool for raw hard disk I/O.
- C/SRC/gpt.cpp: Source for building gpt.exe, a tool for displaying legacy and GPT disk partitions.
- C/SRC/uuid.cpp: Source for building uuid.exe, a tool for managing UUIDs. An option displays the system UUID.
- C/SRC/smbios*.c: Sources for building smbios.exe, a tool for managing the System Management BIOS.
- Added a cleanenv target to all NMakefile files, to help testing multiple versions of the whole SysToolsLib.
- Added a release target to C/NMakefile, to automate building binary releases.

### Changed
- Updated the make system for building the SysLib library, and programs depending on it.
- Batch/trouve.bat: Added options -d, -l, -L.
  Allows finding files containing a string (or not), without getting every matching line.

## [unreleased] 2016-10-12
### Added
- The SysLib library can now be built in Linux, and used in Linux programs.
- Recursive Unix make files in C/, and C/MsvcLibX/, allowing to rebuild all C libraries and tools with a single make command.

## [unreleased] 2016-10-11
### Changed
Moved debugm.h and all common Windows make system scripts and nmake files to C/INCLUDE.  
This avoids having duplicate files in multiple subdirectories.  
Added proxy scripts in each subdirectory to avoid having to add C/INCLUDE to the PATH. 

## [unreleased] 2016-10-08
### Added
- Recursive Windows make files in C/ and C/MsvcLibX/, allowing to rebuild all C libraries and tools with a single make command.

### Changed
- Debug macro DEBUG_ON() now sets the debug level, and a new DEBUG_MORE() increases it.  
  Conversely, new macros DEBUG_LESS() and DEBUG_OFF() reverse the previous ones.  
  All four are usable outside of a DEBUG_CODE() block, and do nothing in release mode.

### Fixed
 - Fixed an incompatiility in MsvcLibX with the (very old) Visual Studio 2003.
 - Target distclean now removes the `config.*.bat` files output by configure.bat.

## [unreleased] 2016-10-04
### Fixed

### Changed
- Batch/Library.bat: New implementation of routine GetPID.
- Docs/catalog.md: Added missing files, and many examples.
- C make system updates to help making releases.

### Fixed
- C/*/All.mak: Fixed errors comparing the WIN95 and WIN32 C compilers.

## [1.5.1] 2016-09-29
### Changed
- C/*/*.mak:
   - Added an OUTDIR variable, to optionally define a different output directory base.
   - Display FAILED messages on the console when compilations or links fail.
- C/*/configure.bat:
   - Make sure the configure.*.bat scripts are invoked in a predictable order: The alphabetic order.
   - Also search for configure.*.bat in %windir% and %HOME%. Allows to globally define your own preferences.
   - Added a -o option to set the OUTDIR variable.  
     (Recommended: In test VMs accessing the host sources, set it in a "%windir%\configure.system.bat" script.)
- PowerShell/PSService.ps1:
   - Added a $ServiceDescription string global setting, and use it for the service registration.

### Fixed
- C/MsvcLibX/include/msvclibx.h: Fixed an issue that prevented the RC compiler to use our new derived windows.h.
- C/SRC/*.c: Minor changes to avoid warnings. No functional code change in most cases.
- C/MsvcLibX/src/main.c: Fixed a bug that caused empty "" arguments to be lost in UTF-8 programs.  
  This affected remplace.exe and redo.exe.
- C/*/dos.mak: Fixed an issue that caused double goal definition warnings, for DOS builds of programs that have their own .mak file.
- PowerShell/PSService.ps1: Fixed issue #5 starting services with a name that begins with a number.

## [1.5] 2016-09-15
### Changed
- C/MsvcLibX/*: Added a windows.h include file, that includes the Windows SDK's own Windows.h, then add its own UTF-8
  extensions. This minimizes changes when converting a Windows ANSI console application to support UTF-8.   
  Moved several internal derived Windows functions with UTF-8 support to their own module, and made them public
  in the new windows.h.
- C/SRC/conv.c:
   - Added the ability to convert a file in-place.
   - Automatically detect if the output file is the same as the input file.
   - Added several options: -same, -bak, -st
   - The help screen now displays the current code pages used in the system.

### Fixed
- C/SRC/*: Fixed several issues that caused build failures in Linux.
- C/SRC/detab.c, lessive.c, remplace.c: Fixed a serious bug that caused a file to be trunctated to 0-length if the output
  file was the same as the input file. Al three now use the same in-place conversion features created for conv.c.
- C/MsvcLibX/src/realpath.c, C/SRC/truename.c:  
   - Bug fix: Add the drive letter if it's not specified.
   - Bug fix: Detect and report output buffer overflows.
   - Convert short WIN32 paths to long paths.
   - Resize output buffers, to avoid wasting lots of memory.
- PowerShell/PSService.ps1: Fixed issue #4 detecting the System account. Now done in a language-independent way.

## [unreleased] 2016-09-05
### Changed
- Added support for C source files encoded as UTF-8 with BOM.  
  This removes a serious weakness in the previous design, where many C/SRC files contained UTF-8 characters, but no BOM.  
  Several Windows tools like Notepad incorrectly identified the encoding, and sometimes corrupted the UTF-8 characters.  
  The change was not trivial, because MS C compilers do react incorrectly when they encounter a UTF-8 BOM:  
   - MSVC 1.5 for DOS fails with an invalid character error.
   - Visual C++ for Win32 switches to a 16-bits character mode that we do _not_ want to use.
- Reencoded many sources as fully UTF-8 with BOM:  
  backnum.c, dirc.c, dirsize.c, driver.c, dump.c, lessive.c, redo.c, remplace.c, truename.c, update.c, which.c, whichinc.c
- Significantly improved conv.c. It's options now on par with that of remplace.c.
- Fixed several bugs in make.bat and configure.bat.

## [unreleased] 2016-06-27
### Changed
- PowerShell/ShadowCopy.ps1
   - Extended the 2-day preservation periods for a 4th week.

   - Added Using and New sample routines.

- PowerShell/PSService.ps1
   - Added PSThread management routines.
   - Added Named Pipe management routines.
   - The -Service handler in the end has been rewritten to be event-driven, with a second thread waiting for control messages coming in via a named pipe.                    

- PowerShell/ShadowCopy.ps1
   - Added 2-day preservation periods for the 2nd & 3rd week.

- PowerShell/Window.ps1
   - Made -Get the default command switch.
   - Allow passing in Window objects via the input pipe.
   - Added the -Step switch to all spacing windows regularly.
   - Added the -WhatIf switch to allow testing moves.
   - Added the -Capture command switch.
   - Added limited support for PowerShell v2.
   - Added the -Children switch to enumerate immediate children.
   - Added the -All switch to enumerate all windows.
   - Get the Program name for all windows in the -All case.
   - Added fields PID and Class to the window objects.
   - Also enumerate popup windows by default.
   - Added a 100ms delay before screen captures, to give time to the system to redraw all fields that are reactivated.

### Fixed
- PowerShell/PSService.ps1:
   - Fixed the -Service finally clause not getting called when stopping the service.
   - Fixed the remaining zombie task when stopping the service.

## [unreleased] 2016-05-11

- Tcl/ilo.tcl           Allow specifying the list of systems in an @inputfile.  
                        Improved routine DnsSearchList, to avoid dependency on twapi in most cases.                                 
                        Improved heuristics to distinguish system and ilo names.
