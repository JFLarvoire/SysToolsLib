# System Tools Catalog

List of tools released on https://github.com/JFLarvoire/SysToolsLib, grouped by function category.

The OS column lists the operating systems supported. D=DOS, W=Windows, L=Linux.

Windows executables usually are available in a WIN32 and WIN64 version.
The WIN32 version runs in all versions of Windows from Windows 95 to Windows 10.
The WIN64 version runs in XP/64 an later versions of 64-bits Windows.

The Linux version of scripts and executables have no extension.

The Windows versions of these tools support Unicode pathnames, long paths > 260 characters, symlinks and junctions. (When the OS supports it.)
The output to the console is Unicode. (It's correct in any code page, provided the console font supports the Unicode characters used.)
The output piped to other apps is correct in any code page. (When the code page supports the Unicode characters used.)
As far as I know, no other Windows port of Unix tools can do all of that, and most can't do any.

## Manipulate structured trees

XML is good for programs, but hard to read for humans.
JSON is easier to read, but not as powerful as XML.
SML is XML made readable. It looks like C. It's strictly equivalent to XML: Any XML file can be converted to SML and back with no loss.

## Notes

* All Tcl scripts require installing a Tcl interpreter.
  This interpreter is standard in Linux, but absent in Windows.
  See the [README](../Tcl/README.md) file in SysToolsLib's Tcl directory for instructions on how to install a Tcl interpreter in Windows.

* All tools (both scripts and C programs) support the -? option for help, and most share a few other common options:

Option | Description
------ | -----------
  -?   | Display a help screen.
       |    
  -d   | Display debug information: Help the author understand what code is running. (In the debug build only)
  -v   | Display verbose information: Help the users understand what the program is doing.
  -V   | Display the script or program version and exit.
  -X   | No-eXec mode: Display what the program would do, but don't do it.
       |    
  -A   | Force ANSI encoding (aka. Windows System Code Page) output. (Windows only)
  -O   | Force OEM encoding (aka. DOS Code Page) output. (Windows only)
  -U   | Force UTF8 encoding output. (Windows only)
